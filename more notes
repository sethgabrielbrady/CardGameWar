HOMEWORK review


keyword >> variable name >> assignmet operator >>value

keyword + var name = declaration
 variable do not have data values
    only the value has a value.....

assignment operator + value = assignment (assigning a value to a declaration)
    instantiation is when a value is assigned at the time of declaration


FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
  -the same input will give you the output

  arguments are the needs defined for the FN - the parameters are the actual or
      fill that need

   keyword >> name >> arguments >> body === codeblock

 ES6

 ex)

 function multiply (x=1, y=1){
    //this says "if you give me an undefined value, the fn will set it to the assigned
    // value";

  return x +y;
 }


NEW STUFF  2/28/17

OBJECTS and ARRAYS

objects are value types
    by def, they contain many values
    objects contain 0 or more values
    objects can contain other objects

    you can access values within an object using "dot"syntax
      console.log(object.valueName)

  a dot signifies the thing o the left is an object

  [] syntax == square bracket syntax

  If you want to use a var when looking at object properties
          YOU MUST use square brackets!!!!!
  You can re-assign values to existing objects
  you can add new properties to objects as well

  you can add functionality to objects IE functions

  'this' will act as the current object name but only within the object itself




ARRAYS
 created with [];
 accessed with the position
  arrays are accessed by their index-not position
[]-brackets access values   (. dot syntax access names)

push  -  adding something to the end of a collection
  ie objects

arrayName.push will add en entry to the end of array.

.includes() will return a boolean about an argument

ITERATION
  doing something over and over again


forEach() is a method-

.split()  will split something with given parameters
      when you split a string it will return an array


      Useful Methods
      There are a bunch of built-in methods that are available on arrays.
      The full list is here, but understanding adding (push), removing (pop, shift, splice),
      finding individual elements ([] operator), and finding the length (length)
      will be a strong start.
