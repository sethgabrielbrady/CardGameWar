Game of War written in Javascript for the front end class. The assignment focuses on arrays, objects, loops, modules, and constructors.

To play, simply clone the repo and install the dependencies with ```npm install``` .
This will install dev dependencies for ```Mocha``` and  ```Chai```.
You must already have node installed.

After dependencies are installed, go to the cloned repo via the terminal and type ```node src/main.js```

You will be presented with each player and their card with a label on the winner,
the date and time, a tally of each players' wins, and the number of ties.
